  Hello! I'm Olly, a physicist-turned-games-programmer.

  I'm looking for programming roles in the games industry, particularly in systems/engine programming.

  I have a Masters in Physics from the University of Oxford, and a PhD in Physics from the University of Warwick.

  I'm currently working towards a Level 7 Apprenticeship in Games Programming at Sumo Digital, Sheffield.

  When I'm not making games, I'm usually playing digital or tabletop games, watching Formula 1, or playing disc golf.
